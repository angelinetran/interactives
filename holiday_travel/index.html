					<h2>Booking A Flight</h2>
					<strong>Fly in the morning and late at night.</strong> Delays are far less likely for morning flights, and airports usually unclog as the afternoon and evening peak passes.</p>
					<strong>Choose nonstop flights.</strong> The worst, most brutal delays occur in connecting airports, where you have no home, friends or family to retreat to.</p>
					<p>For itineraries with connections, it is best if you can muscle your flight path so that connections are in places less likely to experience delays -- specifically, airports in warmer climates.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_plane_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_day_of_flight">
					<h2>Day of Flight</h2>
					<p><strong>Check for Delays.</strong> Before you head to the airport, double-check for flight delays. You can also sign up through an airline's website for flight-delay alerts. Also, have a number for your airline handy in case of flight cancellations.</p>
					<p><strong>Don't Forget Your ID.</strong> Any passenger 18 and older will need a federal or state-issued photo ID at airport checkpoints. All passengers traveling internationally will need their passport.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_plane_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_baggage">
					<h2>Baggage</h2>
					<p><strong>Don't over pack bags.</strong> If security officers have to open them, closing overstuffed bags can be difficult and may result in that checked bag being delayed until a later flight.</p>
					<p><strong>Do not lock bags.</strong> If TSA security officers need to open a locked bag for inspection, they may have to break the lock. If you choose to lock your bag, use a TSA-approved lock, which has a locking system that enables security officers to open and relock the bag.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_plane_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_security">
					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p><strong>3-1-1 Rule</strong>
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Liquids, aerosols and gels must be in containers three ounces or less</li>
						<li>Items must be put in a one-quart, clear plastic zip-top bag and</li>
						<li>Only one zip-top bag per passenger</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Do not wrap gifts.</strong> Wrap them when you reach your destination. If a wrapped gift sets off an alarm, TSA security officers will need to unwrap the gift to check it out.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_plane_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_in_air_comfort">
					<h2>Comfort</h2>
					<p>Bring protein and nutrient-dense dry food that won't easily leak or get smashed in your bag. Examples include nuts, protein bars and firm fruit, like apples.</p>
					<p><strong>Drink plenty of fluids during your trip.</strong> If you can, choose water over other beverages while you're in transit. Avoid soda and an excess amount of alcoholic beverages to minimize travel-related health conditions, such as jet lag.</p>

					<h2>Day Planning</h2>
					<p><strong>Plan time for unexpected stops.</strong> Speaking of extra time… there really is no trophy that I have ever heard of for making good time. The best road trips are just as much about the journey as the destination.</p>
					<p><strong>Avoid rush hour traffic if possible.</strong> It’s one thing to tack on time on your road trip for an interesting roadside attraction. It’s another thing entirely to lose hours sitting in rush hour traffic because you ended up in Chicago at 5 pm. If at all possible, plan your route so that you hit major cities outside of peak driving times.  If that’s not possible, look for bypasses and alternate routes.</p>
					<p><strong>Get the oil changed and your fluids checked before you leave.</strong> Make sure your vehicle is road trip ready before you leave.  Have the oil changed and fill up on windshield wiper fluid.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_car_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_day_of_trip">
					<h2>Day of Trip</h2>
					<p><strong>Check Road Conditions.</strong> If you are traveling in a cold or mountainous region, make sure to check the road conditions before you head out.</p>
					<p>Make sure you have your license, registration and insurance up to date – and actually in the car with you.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_car_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_packing">
					<h2>Packing</h2>
					<p><strong>Pack a cooler with food, snacks and drinks.</strong> Don’t count on finding something deliciously nutritious at a gas station. Load up on water bottles, juice boxes, crackers, pre-made sandwiches, fruit and other travel-friendly snacks. When traveling with kids, try to bring as many individually packed snacks as possible to avoid the need for sharing.</p> <p><strong>Bring a map.</strong>  A real actual paper map that does not talk to you. Sometimes GPS systems malfunction. Have a standby...just in case. Check your route ahead of time to make sure it matches.</p>
					<p><strong>Make a point of packing for automotive emergencies.</strong> Make sure your car has a flashlight, blankets, a car cellphone charger, a can of aerosol tire repair, duct tape and motor oil...just in case!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_car_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_safety">
					<h2>Safety</h2>
					<p><strong>Rest Up.</strong> Get six to eight hours of sleep the night before a long trip. Fatigue decreases reaction time and awareness. The last thing you need on your holiday weekend is an accident.</p>
					<p><strong>Avoid stupid traffic tickets.</strong> You know what’s not fun when you’re on vacation? Having to spend hundreds of dollars from your travel budget or gift-giving on a speeding or seat belt ticket. Yes, wear your seat belt.  Use your turn signal.  Don’t speed...especially through construction zones.</p>
					<p><strong>Get gas before you’re on E.</strong> And fill up the night before the trip. Start looking for your next pit stop when you hit the 3/4 tank mark to avoid any long walks by the side of the road with the little red gas can.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="ss_ht_car_tips ss_ht_content_ab ss_comfort">
					<h2>Comfort</h2>
					<p><strong>Stop every two to three hours to get out of the car and walk around.</strong> Take at least one meal break per day in a table-service restaurant, which allows you to change positions, rather than relying solely on drive-through windows.</p>
					<p><strong>Plan what you'll be listening to in your car.</strong> Listening to audio books or music playlists with your favorite songs are a great way to  make the drive more bearable.</p>
