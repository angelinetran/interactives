                <p>Before applying for a student visa, nonimmigrant students must be accepted by a Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certified United States educational institution. The U.S. Government requires students attending a university, college, high school, private elementary school, seminary, conservatory or other academic institution to obtain an F visa. Students attending vocational or other recognized nonacademic institutions generally need an M visa.</p>

                <p>Typically, student visas are only required for full-time students. For applicants primarily going to the United States for tourism, but who also wish to take a short course, a visitor (B) visa should be adequate.  If the course exceeds 18 hours a week, a student visa will be required.</p>
